# Mobile Close Channel SDK

The Mobile Close Channel SDK allows you to integrate the Close communication platform in your own Android app.

## No buckles needed

We are developers ourselves and we know how frustrating it can be to integrate an SDK. But not this time: we will do our best to make it a fun exercise instead! Pinky promise, this won't be an emotional roller coaster: buckles are not needed!

So, take a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è, tea ü´ñ, or havermelk ü•õ and take my hand to guide you through this in a few easy steps.
If you still run into problems don't hesitate to contact me at renso@thecloseapp.com!
